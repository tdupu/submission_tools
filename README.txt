COMMON BUGS
*****************

*Make sure the file paths are ok. When you call python from PHP the file path changes which tends to create a lot of import problems.

*The data types reading in and out of json files/excel files can be different. Friends: the bash commands 'pwd', 'which', the #! header on the python files. 

*PHP and python need the appropriate permission.
